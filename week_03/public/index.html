			<h2>Working 365 days to Make Sure Your Pet is Happy</h2>
			<p>It is important to leave your pet with someone you can trust when you can’t be there. The kennel staff at Boulevard works 365 days a year to make sure your pet is happy, comfortable, and well taken care of. Additionally, our boarding service comes with the added peace of mind of having veterinary staff overseeing and on call to take care of your pet. All dogs are walked 3-5 times daily in our scenic double fenced courtyard complete with fish pond and porch swing. The enclosure is surrounded by some of the oldest oak trees in Raleigh. </p>

	        <h2>Accomodation!</h2>
            <p>We have ample space to accommodate boarding guests of any size.  Our outdoor runs provide a luxurious area for your pet to run, drink, eat, play, and watch other pets all from the safety of their own space. These accommodations are well ventilated, completely enclosed, and have a doghouse for your pet to enjoy. We also offer indoor climate controlled boarding for all sized dogs and cats. For our feline friends we have a limited number of luxury cat condos in a quiet area that offer climbing space and the solitude that most cats prefer. </p>

            <h2>Day Boarding While You Work or Play</h2>
            <p>We also offer a day boarding service that’s both fun for your pet and convenient for you while you are at work. We give your pet lots of love and play and will often allow social interaction between pets that have great social personalities. </p>
			
			<h2>Staff With Passion</h2>
			<p>Our kennel staff enjoys playing with each and every boarder that stays with us (old-fashioned care doesn't carry any extra expense). For the safety and health of all our boarding guests we require that all boarders be current on vaccinations and free of worms, fleas, and ticks. On the day your pet is scheduled to head home we recommend they receive a grooming package that includes a bath and pedicure. We offer many additional services to accent your pet's stay with us. In addition to a bath and pedicure, we would be delighted to brush your pet, clip out any matted hair, clean their ears, or express their anal glands.</p>
			
			<h2>We Tend to the Unique Care of Your Pet</h2>
			<p>Each pet is unique and comes with their own special needs. Many pets require medications, special diets, or special feeding instructions. Our kennel staff is trained to provide your pet with whatever care they need. Please feel free to bring your pets own food and don’t forget to pick up a new toy or treat for their stay with us.</p>
